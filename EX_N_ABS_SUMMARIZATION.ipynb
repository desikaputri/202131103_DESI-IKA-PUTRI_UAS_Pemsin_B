A couple of years ago business class of Emirates and Qatar were similar but Emirates is sliding down a bit while my experience with Qatar Airways is always top. This time both flights were really not okay: Crew showed no or little interest in you and was chatting in the galley; before, cabin staff  introduced herself to each passenger, not anymore; ICE system not working properly, finally this was solved by a stewardess. Food not bad, but average, no hot towels before takeoff; no amenity kit anymore, new business class with 3 middle seats is strange choice, and claustrophobic, certainly middele seat. Second flight in an a bit outdated an not so clean 777; badly organised priority boarding for business (in fact almost none) in DXB.\",\n          \"\\u2705 Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Cairo via Dubai. Emirates first class is a special travel experience. I could have flown direct to Dubai to transfer for Cairo, but I cut the journey in half by changing planes in Bangkok (saved more than USD2000), although that's 6 sectors of flying in total, but all in first class, and I saved a great deal. 4 sectors were in the spacious A380 with luxurious shower bathroom, the other 2 in B777, all suites. I was served with excellent cuisine, drinks and the service was so attentive without being too intrusive. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on in the sky, and the shower incredible. While I was off to my shower, my bed was made for me, with night snack of fruits and herbal tea all ready. Emirates ICE entertainment system is the best system. The privacy door is a huge bonus especially for sleeping. The vanity mirror, mini on the side etc. Excellent massage function of the seat. USD 1 for 500 MB of wifi data, every detail has been well thought of. Then there is the excellent menu and such extensive wine list! If you got the budget or mileage to upgrade, here's the way to do it to pamper yourself. I took one star off for the inconveniently closed Bangkok lounge due to renovations.

Food not bad, but average, no hot towels before takeoff; no amenity kit anymore, new business class with 3 middle seats is strange choice, and claustrophobic, certainly middele seat.

Emirates first class is a special travel experience. I could have flown direct to Dubai to transfer for Cairo, but I cut the journey in half by changing planes in Bangkok (saved more than USD2000), although that's 6 sectors of flying in total, but all in first class, and I saved a great deal. 4 sectors were in the spacious A380 with luxurious shower bathroom, the other 2 in B777, all suites. I was served with excellent cuisine, drinks and the service was so attentive without being too intrusive. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on in the sky, and the shower incredible. While I was off to my shower, my bed was made for me, with night snack of fruits and herbal tea all ready. Emirates ICE entertainment system is the best system. The privacy door is a huge bonus especially for sleeping. The vanity mirror, mini on the side etc. Excellent massage function of the seat. USD 1 for 500 MB of wifi data, every detail has been well thought of. Then there is the excellent menu and such extensive wine list!

              "17  we booked a trip from london to muscat and then muscat to dubai for a week before returning to the uk emirates left us stranded in muscat airport they had cancelled the flight and not even notified us of this cancellation they had just put us on another flight 40 hours later without telling us we turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist there was no help desk at the airport their app was down and we could not get through to customer service in oman or the uae we tried calling customer service in the uk and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later bearing in mind we were having to use our uk mobiles abroad we had another british couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing i am over six months pregnant and this was meant to be a honeymoon for us because our original wedding and honeymoon were cancelled due to covid in the we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there were not any flights to the uae for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when i was six months pregnant we tried to complain in dubai we were told they could not do anything we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the uk i lodged a complaint we have just received the below response which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to flydubai firstly they are part of the same group and secondly we booked our tickets through emirates they took full payment for the whole itinerary therefore we are their customer we are nothing to do with flydubai they offered us a measly 10 000 miles each which costs them nothing is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago you need a min 50100k to upgrade emirates response thank for your correspondence and naturally i regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport i do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused especially as i understand that you are pregnant if i may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines although there is a partnership emirates and flydubai are two separate companies and emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa in this instance the schedule change occurred to your flight from muscat operated by flydubai whilst i am not aware why their proposed flight ek2033 on 5 november was removed from their schedules in advance of travel i would like to explain that unfortunately there are rare occasions when these can not be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements or other unforeseen circumstances that being said i note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and i would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of emirates as well as our partner flydubai whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline i would suggest you contact your private travel insurers as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations nevertheless as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion i have credited 10 000 goodwill miles to both your skywards accounts miss may i do hope that you will continue to choose emirates in the future   \n",

booked in as vegetarian something which i double checked as i booked through an agent unfortunately i was served vegan food which was appalling they tried to serve the same dreadful dishes twice on the same trip not the gourmet food promised on their website the cabin crew did their best to rustle up something edible but when i finally was served a vegetarian meal on the last flight of the trip a meal which had been rejected by another passenger it was a very hot spicy chick pea meal with a raw chilli in it not everyone reacts well to hot spicy food and i am one of them dubai airport is a disgrace the customer service staff were surly and unhelpful i was not advised that there was a business lounge nearer to my boarding gate the gate number was on the pass so that would not have been difficult resulting in a long last minute dash to the gate on the return flight finding the correct lounge was nigh impossible and i and another passenger had to ask a cleaner as no customer service staff were anywhere to be seen the signage was inadequate as for the fast track passes handed out on both the flights these were meaningless and we were herded through with the rest of the passengers a 15 minute at least bus ride from the plane to the terminal was the last straw to summarise i paid three times the economy price for a lie flat bed and a few glasses of champagne not the exciting wonderful experience promised by emirates and they are so big they really do not care\",\n          \"wish i had read these reviews i paid over 2 500 for tickets from london to dubai to bangladesh for early next year im travelling with my wife and 2 babies 1 2 5 years old the only reason i chose their flights was because it gave the best option of 14 hours in total for flight and transit which is still long with 2 babies but better than 21 5 hours they suddenly decided to change my original flights booked only 10 days before theyve sent me a text and a short email to say this is your new itinerary nothing else i was shocked how could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2 5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract but nothing and when we tried to call their number in london this guy said he cant help us with rebooking or a refund but he can put us
